# Null-Interferometry
A simulation tool for nulling interferometry that models various interferometer configurations and telescope parameters. It analyzes the impact of instrumental errors, pointing jitter, and stellar activity on exoplanet detection SNR, helping to evaluate and optimize high-contrast imaging performance.
